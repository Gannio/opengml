## Tasks
- [ ] Optimizing bytecode compiler of any sort.
- [ ] Completely redo Project.cpp/.hpp. (Resources are okay.)
- [ ] structs
  - [ ] static keyword must work correctly with structs in constructors
  - [ ] struct inheritance

## Behaviour

These need to be checked to see what the intended behaviour is.

- after destroying an instance, can it be collided with? `place_meeting(x, y, destroyed_instance)`? `instance_position()` at the location of the dead instance?

## Iterative builds

- `.manifest.ogmc` containing the following:
    - list of all local, global, globalvar variables in order (the namespaces)
    - (\*) the list of files which contain globalvar, enum, or macro definitions (needed to check for a change, and also for ease of rebuilding)
- full rebuild occurs if any `identifier` (variable, function name, constant) node could be reinterpreted:
    - *any* changes to enums or macros
    - *any* changes to globalvars, asset indices, bytecode indices, or room instances (i.e. if any room file changed.)
    - these can be detected by checking (a) if any of the files (\*) have been updated, or if while preprocessing any of the new/changed files a global accumulation occurs (macro/enum/globalvar).
- minor rebuild:
    - expands namespaces from the ones in the manifest
    - updates manifest
    - may assign different variable->id mappings than a clean rebuild, but who cares?
    - what needs to be rebuilt?
        - all files which are modified since last time!
